# LeechBlock
LeechBlock is a simple productivity tool designed to block those time-wasting sites that can suck the life out of your working day. All you need to do is specify which sites to block and when to block them.

NOTE: This is the legacy version of LeechBlock, which has been superseded by LeechBlock NG (https://github.com/proginosko/LeechBlockNG).
